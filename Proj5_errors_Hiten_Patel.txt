1) I couldn't figure out how to fill up the HashMap the first time command 20 is called. Then I thought
	of having a static variable so that when command 20 would be called for the 2nd time, it would know 
	that the HashMap has already been filled up.
	
2) To get rid the spaces in the beginning of the string for command 20 I used trim() to get ride of them.

3) If a new key were to be added to the HashMap, then I also had to create an ArrayList for the value
	every time a new key was added.
